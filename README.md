# Building an End-to-end Medical Chatbot using Llama2 for Custom Healthcare Data 

- **Developed** a cutting-edge medical chatbot powered by Llama2, leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques to revolutionize the healthcare industry.
- **Gathered** and preprocessed healthcare-specific PDF documents for comprehensive training and evaluation, ensuring high-quality text extraction and chunking.
- **Utilized** various technologies including Flask for web application development, LangChain for text extraction and management, Pinecone for similarity search, and HuggingFace for text embeddings.
- **Implemented** PDF data extraction with PyPDFLoader and DirectoryLoader, and text chunking with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to handle large documents effectively.
- **Employed** the sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from HuggingFace for generating text embeddings, facilitating accurate text representation.
- **Initialized** Pinecone for storing and retrieving document vectors, enabling efficient similarity searches and enhancing the chatbot's retrieval capabilities.
- **Adopted** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the chatbot’s ability to fetch relevant information and generate contextually appropriate responses.
- **Designed** custom prompts using PromptTemplate for prompt engineering, guiding the AI’s responses for accurate and helpful interactions.
- **Integrated** LLaMA (Llama2) with the CTransformers library to provide high-quality conversational AI responses.
- **Created** a user-friendly web application with Flask, allowing users to interact with the chatbot and receive instant responses in a seamless manner.
